Despite being headquartered in Alicante, Spain; the company has many international clients and connections, primarily in Latin America.<div class=big-img><div class="card no-hover"><img alt="Facephi Headquarters in Alicante, Spain" class="card-content unselectable" src=../files/work/facephi/office.jpg><div class=card-center>Facephi Headquarters in Alicante, Spain</div></div></div><h2 id=my_experience>My experience at the company</h2><p>My tenure at Facephi was quite short but really interesting nontheless. When I joined the company in late 2025, it had well over 200 employees, making it quite the jump in size over <a class=link href=/career/compliance_cms>my previous employer</a>, which had less than 10. I was also placed into R&D, one of the bigger departments of the company, which helped make this difference even more stark.<p>Because R&D is such a large department, it was further split up into subdepartments, where most tasks landed. However, a small group of developers was kept to work in department-wide tasks, and as such didn't belong to any subdepartment.<p>I found myself wrangled into said small group of developers, and although it gave me greater independence and autonomy, it also made it a bit tougher at times to properly coordinate with other members of R&D.<h2 id=tools>Automation tools</h2><p>While working at the company, most of my time was spent building internal tools to speedup and automate tiresome, repetitive tasks. Most tools, despite being relatively simple in concept, required multiple integrations with the company's existing systems, which complicated the implementation quite a bit.<p>Building tools by myself in such a new environment right out of the gate was quite overwhelming. Despite this, and mostly thanks to my previous job, I had quite a lot of experience managing projects entirely by myself, and once I grew accustomed to Facephi's systems the development went smoothly.<p>All tools were developed in Python, using a multitude of libraries and APIs to implement their business logic, including <a class=link href=https://github.com/gtalarico/pyairtable target=_blank>pyAirtable <i class=ri-external-link-line></i></a>, <a class=link href=https://github.com/O365/python-o365 target=_blank>Python-O365 <i class=ri-external-link-line></i></a>, and <a class=link href=https://github.com/pycontribs/jira target=_blank>Jira Python <i class=ri-external-link-line></i></a>; among many others. The AI Agents that some tools leveraged were built using the LangGraph/LangChain framework, and most tools were automated using Github Actions.<h2 id=scrapping>Data scrapping project</h2><p>Another big project that I took part in was a Data Scrapping project, which was responsible for extracting suitable images for further use. Although I cannot delve into the details of the project, I fully programmed the scrapper application by myself, and it was completely automated. The scrapper made heavy use of the <a class=link href=https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui target=_blank>pyAutoGUI <i class=ri-external-link-line></i></a>, for automatic interaction with GUI applications.<p>I also was entirely responsible for collecting all the scrapped images and delivering them to the Data R&D subdepartment for further processing, with the ultimate goal of using them to train and improve production models.<p>Although my contribution to the project ended when I delivered the final batch of images, it felt quite satisfying when, from time to time, I would see members of Data working with images that were extracted by my application.<h2 id=closing>Closing thoughts</h2><p>Despite my short stay at the company, it was quite formative, mainly because it was my first taste in working in a big company. Even if it felt overwhelming at times, in retrospect I now feel quite proud of what I managed to accomplish in just a few months.</div></div><div style="color: #00000000" class=unselectable>.</div><footer><div class=content><span class=footer-text id=footer-text> © 2025 Vicent Baeza </span><div class=footer-buttons><a class="btn highlight" href=https://linkedin.com/in/vbaeza/ target=_blank title=LinkedIn> <i class="ri-linkedin-box-fill ri-lg"></i> </a><a class="btn highlight" href=mailto:vicentbaeza7@gmail.com target=_blank title=Email> <i class="ri-mail-fill ri-lg"></i> </a><a class="btn highlight" href=https://github.com/vicent-baeza target=_blank title=GitHub> <i class="ri-github-fill ri-lg"></i> </a></div></div></footer><div id=fullscreen><div id=fullscreen-image><img alt="Estalmat Certificate" class=card-content src=files/education/estalmat/diploma.jpg></div><div class="card card-hl" id=fullscreen-card><div class=card-title id=fullscreen-card-title>Estalmat Participation Certificate</div><div class=card-date id=fullscreen-card-date>05/2017</div><div class=card-content id=fullscreen-card-content></div></div></div><div id=search-bg><div id=search-div><input placeholder="Search for pages..." id=search-textbox><div id=search-separator></div><div id=search-options><a class=search-option> <div class=search-option-text>Home</div> <div class=search-option-divider></div> <div class=search-option-link>/</div> </a><a class=search-option> <div class=search-option-text>Career: Work</div> <div class=search-option-divider></div> <div class=search-option-link>/career#work</div> </a><a class=search-option> <div class=search-option-text>Compliance CMS</div> <div class=search-option-divider></div> <div class=search-option-link>/career/compliance_cms</div> </a><a class=search-option> <div class=search-option-text>Compliance CMS: My Experience</div> <div class=search-option-divider></div> <div class=search-option-link>/career/compliance_cms#my_experience</div> </a><a class=search-option> <div class=search-option-text>Compliance CMS: My Experience</div> <div class=search-option-divider></div> <div class=search-option-link>/career/compliance_cms#my_experience</div> </a><a class=search-option> <div class=search-option-text>Compliance CMS: My Experience</div> <div class=search-option-divider></div> <div class=search-option-link>/career/compliance_cms#my_experience</div> </a></div></div></div>
